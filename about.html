    <h1>About Covelo Fire Department</h1>
    <p>The Covelo Fire Department, also known as the Covelo Fire Protection District, has served the Round Valley community of Mendocino County for decades as a volunteer-based agency. While exact founding records are limited, the department has a longstanding tradition of service and dedication to public safety.</p>

    <p>Historically led by part-time and volunteer leadership, the department has recently taken significant steps forward, including appointing its first full-time fire chief to enhance oversight, coordination, and operational capabilities. This progress reflects the communityâ€™s continued investment in quality emergency response and proactive fire prevention efforts.</p>

    <p>Operating from Station #1, located at <strong>75900 Covelo Road, Covelo, CA</strong>, Covelo Fire provides fire suppression, medical emergency response, and public education services. The department is proud to collaborate with local, state, and federal partners to serve the unique rural landscape of Round Valley.</p>

    <h2>Fire Chief Ruben Mendoza</h2>
    <p><strong>Chief Ruben Mendoza</strong> leads the department with a deep commitment to service and community. As Covelo Fire Department's first full-time fire chief, Ruben brings years of experience in emergency response, wildfire operations, and rural fire service leadership. His dedication to improving volunteer training, modernizing operations, and enhancing community trust has positioned Covelo Fire for a new era of growth and resilience.</p>
